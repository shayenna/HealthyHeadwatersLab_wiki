# Lab Vehicle

The Healthy Headwaters Lab has a lab vehicle named CJ (for the license plate!). Due to GLIER policies, only staff members are allowed to drive CJ. CJ is generally parked behind GLIER in the parking lot, and two sets of keys are held by Catherine and Jess Ives. When using CJ, make sure the Healthy Headwaters Lab magnets are placed on the doors so it can be identified as a University vehicle. This is especially important when parking on campus to avoid a parking ticket.  

When using CJ for meetings/field work/etc., please sign her out on the lab Google Calendar.  

When you use CJ, always be considerate of your teammates! If the tank is less than half full, please fill it up. To avoid incurring costs on your personal card, you can either sign out the Travel Card from Catherine before leaving for your trip, or borrow it when you return to make a special trip to the gas station. **You must keep the receipt and give it to Catherine when returning the card**.

A maintenance record for CJ can be found in Shared HHL Dropbox/Equipment_Maintenance_records.xlsx
