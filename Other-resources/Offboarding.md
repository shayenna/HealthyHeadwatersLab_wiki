# When you leave the lab

- [ ] Make sure all of your data files are cleanly labeled, up-to-date, and uploaded to the shared Dropbox so they will be available to future lab members.  
- [ ] Ensure your R code is *well commented* and can be easily followed by the rest of the team.
- [ ] Export or save any emails that may be important in the future (dependant on continued email access)
- [ ] Work with Catherine to develop a storage plan for any existing samples
- [ ] Update any lab or field protocols you used during your time in the lab, especially identifying areas where you may have developed improvements on the existing written protocols
- [ ] Have an exit interview with Catherine to discuss your overall experience in the lab, and to bring up areas where we can improve
- [ ] Stay in touch!
